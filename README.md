# proxy-api

Here's a Python Flask implementation of a proxy API service that handles GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and forwards them to a target URL:

This implementation includes:

    Basic Setup:
        Uses Flask as the web framework
        Imports necessary libraries (requests for making HTTP requests)
        Configurable target base URL
    Forward Request Helper:
        Handles the actual proxying of requests
        Removes hop-by-hop headers that shouldn't be forwarded
        Preserves headers, body, and query parameters
        Includes error handling for failed requests
    Route Handling:
        Single route that captures all paths using <path:path>
        Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
        Special handling for root path ('/')
    Features:
        Preserves original request method
        Forwards headers (minus hop-by-hop headers)
        Forwards request body
        Forwards query parameters
        Returns target service status code and headers
        Includes timeout protection
    Error Handling:
        Custom 404 and 405 responses
        Generic error handling for failed proxy requests

To use this proxy API:

    Install required packages:

bash

pip install flask requests

    Modify TARGET_BASE_URL to point to your desired target service.
    Run the script:

bash

python proxy.py

Example usage:
bash

# GET request
curl http://localhost:5000/users

# POST request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John"}'

# PUT request
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Updated"}'

# DELETE request
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/users/1

Additional considerations for production use:

    Add authentication/authorization
    Implement rate limiting
    Add logging
    Configure proper timeout values
    Add input validation
    Set debug=False
    Use a production WSGI server (e.g., gunicorn)
    Add proper SSL/TLS support
    Add more robust error handling
    Consider adding caching if appropriate
